# Beer Order App
React app that allows users to add items to a cart

 Make sure to include in app description that is potential manufacturing of an error is part of showcasing additional react-routing skills (though obviously logically altering fetched data in the array would suffice as well)
 
 
 adding custom hooks for animation and error logic
 tailwindcss +cusomtization of animations, screens, etc.
 portals
 general functional build techniques (useEffect, state, context, etc)
 
 
 in the future, adding local storage to save user session data would be a nice addition

how i imporoved it over time:
condensing code repetition (custom hooks, <Paginatino /> component, <TextButton /> component, etc) -- show exaples with code!
